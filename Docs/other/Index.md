## Setting up records
Read the [domain file structure](/Docs/json) and setup the records accordingly.

## Configuring your server
After the pull request is merged, configure your server (apache, nginx, etc.) to work with `<subdomain>.is-a.dev`. If you are unsure how to configure your server, you can create an issue for support.

You should also, include `<subdomain>.is-a.dev` in your ssl certificate to get rid of certificate errors.
