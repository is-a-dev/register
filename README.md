### NS Records
When applying for NS records, please be aware we already support a [wide range of DNS records](https://docs.is-a.dev/faq/#which-records-are-supported), so likely do not not need them. 

In your PR, please explain why you need NS records, including examples, to help mitigate potential abuse. Refer to the [FAQ](https://docs.is-a.dev/faq/#who-can-use-ns-records) for guidelines on allowed usage.

***Pull requests adding NS records without sufficient reasoning will be closed.***
